<p>Apache Subversion 1.12 is a superset of all previous Subversion
releases, and is as of the time of its release considered the current
"best" release.  Any feature or bugfix in 1.0.x through 1.11.x is also
in 1.12, but 1.12 contains features and bugfixes not present in any
earlier release.  The new features will eventually be documented in a
1.12 version of the free Subversion book
(<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" >svnbook.red-bean.com</a>).</p>

<p>This page describes only major changes.  For a complete list of
changes, see the 1.12 section of the <a
href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/CHANGES" >CHANGES</a>
file.</p>

<div class="h2" id="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#compatibility"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.12
servers and clients.  However, some of the new 1.12 features may not be
available unless both client and server are the latest version.  There are
also cases where a new feature will work but will run less efficiently if
the client is new and the server old.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no need</strong> to <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnadmin"
>dump and reload</a> your repositories. 
Subversion 1.12 servers can read and write to repositories created by
earlier versions.  To upgrade an existing server installation, just install the
newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.12 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions, never removing old ones.  A
program written to any previous 1.x API can both compile
and run using 1.12 libraries.  However, a program written for 1.12
cannot necessarily compile or run against older libraries.</p>

<p>There may be limited cases where the behavior of old APIs has been
slightly modified from previous releases.  These are cases where edge cases
of the functionality has been deemed buggy, and therefore improved or removed.
Please consult the
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/api-errata/1.12/"
>API errata</a> for more detailed information on what these APIs are
and what impact these changes may have.</p>

<h3>Upgrading the Working Copy
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#wc-upgrade"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.12 uses the same working copy format as Subversion 1.8 through 1.11.</p>

<p>Before using Subversion 1.12 with an existing Subversion 1.7 or older
working copy, users will be required to run the <tt>svn upgrade</tt> command
to upgrade working copy metadata to the new format. This command may take a
while in some cases, and for some users, it may be more practical to simply
checkout a new working copy.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subversion 1.12 cannot upgrade working copies that
a 1.6 client would have refused to operate upon before an <tt>svn cleanup</tt>
was run (with a 1.6 client).  In other words, before upgrading to 1.8 or newer,
a 1.6
or older client must be used to run <tt>svn cleanup</tt> on all 1.6 or older
working copies that require cleanup.  Likewise, Subversion 1.12 cannot upgrade
corrupt working copies. Unfixable problems can arise from missing or corrupt
meta-data inside <tt>.svn</tt> directories.  Such damage to the working copy
is permanent, and cannot be fixed even if <tt>svn cleanup</tt> is run prior
to the upgrade.</p>

<p>If your working copy does not upgrade cleanly, please check out a new one.

</table>

<p>During <tt>svn update</tt>, the deletion of a directory which contains
unversioned items but is otherwise unmodified no longer causes a tree
conflict. This avoids tree conflicts caused by software build artifacts
in the working copy, for example.</p>

<p>Several bugs have been fixed in the conflict resolver, including a case
where text conflicts were created with the incoming changes (theirs) and
local changes (mine) swapped within text conflict markers. Which caused
unexpected results when the <tt>svn resolve</tt> command was used with
the <tt>--accept theirs</tt> or <tt>--accept mine</tt> options.</p>

<p>Support for unversioned items and fixes for conflict resolver bugs found
during the development of Subversion 1.12 have been backported to the
<a href="1.10.html">Subversion 1.10</a> and
<a href="1.11.html">Subversion 1.11</a> release series as well.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.12 is one of the new 6-month regular releases with an
emphasis on introducing new features more quickly and a shorter support
period. It will be supported for 6 months, and then will be superseded by
the next regular release.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.11, the previous regular release, is no longer supported.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.9 and 1.10 are still supported, now being regarded as
long-term support (LTS) releases. The next LTS release is expected to be
numbered 1.14, to be released two years after 1.10.</p>
