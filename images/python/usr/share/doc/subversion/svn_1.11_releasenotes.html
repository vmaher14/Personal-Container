<h1 style="text-align: center">Apache Subversion 1.11 Release Notes</h1>

<div class="notice">
<p>New 6-month regular and 2-year LTS release schedule.</p>
<p>Subversion 1.11 is the first of the new 6-month regular releases with an
emphasis on introducing new features more quickly and a shorter support
period. See
<a href="#non-lts-release">Subversion 1.11 is a Regular Release</a>
below.</p>

<p>Apache Subversion 1.11 is a superset of all previous Subversion
releases, and is as of the time of its release considered the current
"best" release.  Any feature or bugfix in 1.0.x through 1.10.x is also
in 1.11, but 1.11 contains features and bugfixes not present in any
earlier release.  The new features will eventually be documented in a
1.11 version of the free Subversion book
(<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" >svnbook.red-bean.com</a>).</p>

<p>This page describes only major changes.  For a complete list of
changes, see the 1.11 section of the <a
href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/CHANGES" >CHANGES</a>
file.</p>

<div class="h2" id="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#compatibility"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.11
servers and clients.  However, some of the new 1.11 features may not be
available unless both client and server are the latest version.  There are
also cases where a new feature will work but will run less efficiently if
the client is new and the server old.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no need</strong> to <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnadmin"
>dump and reload</a> your repositories. 
Subversion 1.11 servers can read and write to repositories created by
earlier versions.  To upgrade an existing server installation, just install the
newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.11 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions, never removing old ones.  A
program written to any previous 1.x API can both compile
and run using 1.11 libraries.  However, a program written for 1.11
cannot necessarily compile or run against older libraries.</p>

<p>There may be limited cases where the behavior of old APIs has been
slightly modified from previous releases.  These are cases where edge cases
of the functionality has been deemed buggy, and therefore improved or removed.
Please consult the
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/api-errata/1.11/"
>API errata</a> for more detailed information on what these APIs are
and what impact these changes may have.</p>

<h3>Upgrading the Working Copy
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#wc-upgrade"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.11 uses the same working copy format as Subversion 1.8 through 1.10.</p>

<p>Before using Subversion 1.11 with an existing Subversion 1.7 or older
working copy, users will be required to run the <tt>svn upgrade</tt> command
to upgrade working copy metadata to the new format. This command may take a
while in some cases, and for some users, it may be more practical to simply
checkout a new working copy.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subversion 1.11 cannot upgrade working copies that
a 1.6 client would have refused to operate upon before an <tt>svn cleanup</tt>
was run (with a 1.6 client).  In other words, before upgrading to 1.8 or newer,
a 1.6
or older client must be used to run <tt>svn cleanup</tt> on all 1.6 or older
working copies that require cleanup.  Likewise, Subversion 1.11 cannot upgrade
corrupt working copies. Unfixable problems can arise from missing or corrupt
meta-data inside <tt>.svn</tt> directories.  Such damage to the working copy
is permanent, and cannot be fixed even if <tt>svn cleanup</tt> is run prior
to the upgrade.</p>

<p>If your working copy does not upgrade cleanly, please check out a new one.
</p>

<h3>Shelving (experimental): transition from 1.10
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#shelving-transition"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>The presence in the working copy of any shelves that were created by
Subversion 1.10 has no effect on a Subversion 1.11 client. Subversion 1.11
will ignore them; it cannot interoperate with them nor even list their
presence.</p>

<p>The <tt>svn upgrade</tt> command has no effect, as the working copy
format is formally unchanged.</p>

<p>Shelves are currently stored under
<tt><i>&lt;WC&gt;</i>/.svn/experimental/shelves/</tt>. In Subversion 1.10,
shelves were stored under <tt><i>&lt;WC&gt;</i>/.svn/shelves/</tt> as patch
files.</p>

<p>To recover a shelf created by 1.10, either
<ul><li>use a 1.10 client to find and unshelve it, or</li>
    <li>find the patch file by hand and use any 1.10 or later
        <tt>svn patch</tt> to apply it.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Subversion 1.11 provides an experimental first cut at solving some of the
use cases envisioned in <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-3626">issue #3626</a> named
"Commit checkpointing".</p>

<div class="notice">
  <p><span style="color: red"><b>WARNING:</b></span> The checkpointing feature
  is designated "EXPERIMENTAL" in 1.11. It is being released in an early form

  while it remains experimental.</p>
</div>

<p>It provides the ability to save a snapshot of an uncommitted change from
time to time, and later restore one of those previous versions of your
change back into the working copy.</p>

<p>It does not provide the kind of exact WC state roll back that is also
discussed in that issue, that could make it possible after a messy update to
roll back to the exact WC state that existed just before. This remains a
future possibility.</p>

<p>The ability to checkpoint and roll back an uncommitted change is provided
within the shelving feature, by letting a shelf hold multiple versions of
your change. Therefore, see also <a href="#shelving"> Shelving</a>.</p>

<p>The main checkpointing operations are accomplished by the following
commands, as also listed in
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/70cYBQ">the Wiki page</a>:</p>

<table>

        <tt>svn x-<b>unshelve</b> foo 3</tt></td>
    <td>apply version 3 of shelf 'foo' to the WC<br/>

<h4>Improved Shelving (experimental)
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#shelving"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>Shelving (<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-3625">issue
#3625</a>), first introduced in Subversion 1.10, is improved in 1.11 to
handle more kinds of changes more robustly.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <p><span style="color: red"><b>WARNING:</b></span> The shelving feature is
  designated "EXPERIMENTAL" in 1.11. It is being released in an early form
  while development continues. It is expected to change significantly during
  and after the 1.11.x series. There is no promise of backward compatibility
  while it remains experimental.</p>
</div>

<p>Shelving in 1.11 is incompatible with shelves created by 1.10. See
<a href="#shelving-transition">the transition notes</a> on recovering 1.10
shelves and differences in commands.</p>

<p>The main improvements and changes are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>checkpointing support: a shelf stores multiple versions of a
        change; shelving adds a new version to the named shelf; you can
        unshelve an older version instead of the newest&mdash;see the
        <a href="#checkpointing">checkpointing</a> feature</li>
    <li>'binary' files (and property values) are fully supported</li>
    <li>patch files are no longer used as the storage mechanism;
        limitations and bugs due to patch file format are gone, such as
        handling svn:mergeinfo properties, binary data, and end-of-line
        characters</li>
    <li>shelving and unshelving both warn and refuse to run if they detect
        states that they cannot handle (e.g. copies or moves)</li>
    <li>unshelving applies the changes to the WC using a mechanism similar
        to merging, so that changes can be more robustly applied when the
        WC has been modified (e.g. updated) since the shelf was saved</li>
</ul>

<p>The kinds of change you can shelve are committable changes to files and
properties, except the following kinds which are not yet supported:</p>
<ul>
    <li>copies and moves</li>
    <li>creating and deleting directories</li>
</ul>

<p>Shelving commands (see their help for details):</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>svn x-shelf-diff</tt></li>
    <li><tt>svn x-shelf-drop</tt></li>
    <li><tt>svn x-shelf-list, x-shelves</tt></li>

<h4>Improvements to the interactive conflict resolver
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#conflict-resolver"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>The interactive conflict resolver now supports more conflict situations
which involve moved files and directories. Specifically, many tree conflicts
which report a "locally missing" item, as a result of an item having moved
on the merge source branch, can now be resolved automatically.</p>

<p>For example, when a file edit is cherry-picked from a branch on which
the edited file has been renamed, the edit will now be applied to the file's
location in the merge target branch, provided it has not been renamed
on that branch as well. For details, see
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4694">issue #4694</a>,
"Unresolvable tree conflict when cherrypicking a file-edit after file was
moved on source branch".</p>

<p>Several bugs have been fixed in the conflict resolver, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4744">Issue #4744</a>
&quot;assertion failed (start_rev &gt; end_rev)&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4766">Issue #4766</a>
&quot;resolver adds unrelated moves to move target list&quot;</li>
<li>A problem where the resolver mistakenly
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/r1839662">searched back through
the entire history of the repository</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Fixes for conflict resolver bugs found during the development of
Subversion 1.11 have been backported to the
<a href="1.10.html">Subversion 1.10</a> release series as well.</p>

<p>There are some known issues in the Subversion 1.11 releases.  These
may be fixed in later 1.11.x releases.</p>

<h3>Ruby bindings require swig 3.0.9
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#ruby-swig-issue-602"

</h3>

<p><em>This section only affects those who build Subversion from a working
  copy.  If you build Subversion from a tarball or zip file, you may skip
  this section.</em></p>

<p>The Ruby bindings are known not to build with swig version 3.0.8 (and only
that version) due to <a href="https://github.com/swig/swig/issues/602">swig
issue #602</a>.  We recommend to use swig 3.0.9 or newer.</p>

<p>The failure is detected by the test suite.
To test whether your version of swig is affected, run
<tt>make check-swig-rb</tt>.  (Some distros might have backported the swig
patch into their swig-3.0.8 packages.)</p>

<p>The Perl and Python bindings are not affected.</p>

<h3>Github's SVN Bridge server implementation incompatible with SVN 1.11
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#github-issue"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4789">Issue #4789</a></p>

<p>During November 2018 Subversion 1.11 clients were unable to
check out repositories from Github. Stricter DAV RFC conformance checks
had been added to SVN 1.11 clients, and Github's custom SVN server implementation
did not conform to the newly expected behaviour. Github has since fixed the
issues on their end, so all Subversion clients should be able to use Github's
SVN bridge again.

<p>Subversion 1.11 introduces new features and makes use of new techniques
which can trigger problems not encountered in previous versions. In contrast to
known issues, things listed here are not due to some bug or issue in Subversion
itself and therefore cannot be fixed with a new patch release.
This section lists all known problems and provides instructions to solve them,
if they occur.</p>

<p>There are no known issues specific to this release at the moment.</p>

<h2>Subversion 1.11 is a Regular Release
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#non-lts-release"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Subversion 1.11 is the first of the new 6-month regular releases with an
emphasis on introducing new features more quickly and a shorter support
period.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.9 and 1.10 are still supported, now being regarded as
long-term support (LTS) releases. The next LTS release is expected to be
numbered 1.14, to be released two years after 1.10.</p>
